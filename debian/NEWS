aptitude (0.6.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Summary: the behavior of "full-upgrade"/"dist-upgrade" has changed
  in a way that could break scripts.  See below for details.

  This version changes the behavior of the full-upgrade/dist-upgrade
  command when additional arguments are present.  Previous versions of
  aptitude used the command-line arguments to extend the default upgrade
  set, so that

    # aptitude full-upgrade wesnoth

  would install "wesnoth" while attempting to upgrade all other
  upgradable packages.

  In version 0.6.1.4, aptitude now uses the list of packages as the
  explicit list of upgrades to perform.  Thus, the same command

    # aptitude full-upgrade wesnoth

  will upgrade wesnoth and not perform any other actions.  If wesnoth
  isn't installed, nothing will happen.  To get the old behavior, add
  "?upgradable" as the first argument following "full-upgrade" and add
  "+" to the end of each package that had no qualifiers:

    # aptitude full-upgrade "?upgradable" wesnoth+
